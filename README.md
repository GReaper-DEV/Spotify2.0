# Spotify 2.0 Clone

This project is a Spotify 2.0 Clone inspired by the tutorial video [Build a Spotify 2.0 Music App with React.js!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1cpb0tYV74). The application was developed to replicate some of the core features of Spotify, using the Shazam Core API and React.js.

## Features
- **Discover Songs**: Fetch songs based on the Genres, Top Artists, Top Charts, World Charts, Search and Around You.
- **Now Playing**: View the currently playing track.
- **Player Controls**: Play, pause, skip, and manage playback.

## Tech Stack
- **React.js**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Shazam Core API**: Integration with Spotify's services.
- **TailwindCSS**: Styling for the application.

## Status
Unfortunately, this project no longer works due to updates in the Shazam Core API that are incompatible with the implementation in this project. Changes in the  endpoints may require significant modifications to restore functionality.

## Limitations
- This project is for educational purposes and is not a fully functional Spotify replacement.
- Due to Shazam Core API changes, additional development is needed to make this app functional again.
